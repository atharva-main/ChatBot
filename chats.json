Here's a simple binary search algorithm implemented in Python:\n\n```python\ndef binary_search(arr, low, high, x):\n\n    # Check base case\n    if high >= low:\n\n        mid = (high + low) // 2\n\n        # If element is present at the middle itself\n        if arr[mid] == x:\n            return mid\n\n        # If element is smaller than mid, then it can only be present in left subarray\n        elif arr[mid] > x:\n            return binary_search(arr, low, mid - 1, x)\n\n        # Else the element can only be present in right subarray\n        else:\n            return binary_search(arr, mid + 1, high, x)\n\n    else:\n        # Element is not present in array\n        return -1\n\n# Test array\narr = [2, 3, 4, 10, 40]\nx = 10\n\n# Function call\nresult = binary_search(arr, 0, len(arr)-1, x)\n\nif result != -1:\n    print(\"Element is present at index\", str(result))\nelse:\n    print(\"Element is not present in array\")\n```\n\nThis code defines a binary search function `binary_search` that takes an array, the lower and upper bounds of the search, and the value to be searched for as inputs. The function returns the index of the value if it is found, and -1 if it is not found. The test array in this example is `[2, 3, 4, 10, 40]`, and the value to be searched for is `10`. The output of this code is `Element is present at index 3`.",
