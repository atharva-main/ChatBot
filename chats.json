The function `binary_search` takes four parameters: the input array, the lower and upper bounds of the array, and the element to search for. It calculates the middle index of the array, and if the element is found at that index, it returns that index. If the element is greater than the middle element, it searches the left half of the array. If the element is less than the middle element, it searches the right half. If the element is not found, it returns -1. The test at the end demonstrates the usage of the `binary_search` function.",
